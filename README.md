## Purpose
        Its purpose is:
            to show what services the specialist offers;
            to check if there are free hours and book if it's possible;
            to reserve manicure hours;
            to show reserved hours only to the client and the specialist for 
                whom the appointment is made;
            to edit its appointment and change it if its available.        
            to show if the specialist has a day off
            to show a gallery in which only the employee can upload photos 
                of their work;
            to show contacts and information about the specialist

            The user has access to their profile and can accordingly edit 
                and delete it if they wish;

## The project has 5 apps
    
    üë§ accounts;
    ‚è≥ appointments;
    üì∑ photos;
    üíÖ services;
    üè† studio;

### üë§ accounts app
    This app, contains the user profile logic.
    It has One BaseUser model and two children for 
    different user roles(EmployeeBio and ClientProfile).

    Models have additional validators for img size and 
    phone number validation.

    Every new user is set as client with the help of a signal.
    The employee profiles are set only 
    by admin user through admin panel. Upon creation the signal
    checks if the new user has status and if not employee- it is
    set as client.
    
    The user has option to authenticat with its email. 
    The 'ModelBackend' is rewritten.
    
    It has also an option to log in with Google email. 
    It uses a pipeline which checks if the user logs for first time,
    redirecting it to fill a form for completing it's profile(Save in DB).
    The authentication process goes through SOCIAL_AUTH_PIPELINE steps using 
    social authentication, such as Google authentication via django-allauth 
    or social-auth-app-django.
    They are arranged in order and sepparated with comments for better readability.

    The client profile has full CRUD operations on his profil and can:
        upload profile picture;
        edit profil info;
        delete profil.
    In addition, the employee profil has a biography section and has the 
    permission to add certificates, which appear in the Contacts page as
    part of personal business card.

### ‚è≥ appointments app
    This app contains the appointments logic.
    It has two models: Appointment & DayOff
    
    The Appointment model gets the info for user, employee and service through 
    ForeignKey and also its data: date, start_time and comment.
    It has validator that is called in the model's save method.
    The validator 'AppointmentModelCleanValidator', checks if employee, service, 
    date and start_time are picked.
    Also checks if the Day is valid(present day and working day) and user can book
    an appointment only if the range (in minutes) fits the free time between 
    appointments. In other words it can not book during the time when the
    nail artist is awready busy.

    It also have a feature to check for available hours on a current date. 
    The service is looking for available appointments on a 
    selected date.

    The DayOff model gets the info for employee also through ForeignKey and 
    has date fierld. It's main goal is to give the employee opportunity to 
    take a break on a day of his choice, only if this day is free of appointments.

            UPLOAD/DELETE; 

        certificate photos, show degree and are displayed in
            the address page, where employee info takes place.
