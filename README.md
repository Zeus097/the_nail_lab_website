    üì∑ photos;
    üíÖ services;

### üë§ accounts app
    This app, contains the user profile logic.
    It has One BaseUser model and two children for different user roles(EmployeeBio and ClientProfile).
    Models have additional validators for img size and phone number validation.
    Every new user is set as client with the help of a signal. The employee profiles are set only 
    by admin user through admin panel. Upon creation the signal checks if the new user has status and 
    if not employee it is set as client.
    The user has option to authenticat with its email. The 'ModelBackend' is rewritten.
    
    It has also an option to log in with Google email. It uses a pipeline which checks if the user logs for first time,
    redirecting it to fill a form for to complete it's profile(Save in DB).
    The authentication process goes through SOCIAL_AUTH_PIPELINE steps using 
    social authentication, such as Google authentication via django-allauth or social-auth-app-django.
    They are arranged in order and sepparated with comments for better readability.

    The client profile has full CRUD operations on his profil and can:
        upload profile picture;
        edit profil info;
        delete profil.
    In addition, the employee profil has a biography section and has the permission to add certificates,
    which appear in the Contacts page as part of his business card.

### appointments app
    This app contains the appointments logic.
    It has two models: Appointment & DayOff
    
    The Appointment model gets the info for user, employee and service through ForeignKey and also its data:
    date, start_time and comment.
    It has validator that is called in the model's save method.
    The validator 'AppointmentModelCleanValidator', checks if employee, service, date and start_time are picked.
    Also checks if the Day is valid(present day and working day) and user can book an appointment only if the 
    range (in minutes) fits the free time between appointments. In other words it can not book during the time when the
    nail artist is awready busy.
    
    The DayOff model gets the info for employee also through ForeignKey and has date fierld.
    It's main goal is to give the employee opportunity to take a break on a day of his choice, only if this day
    is free of appointments.
