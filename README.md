### üë§ accounts app

<span style="font-weight: bold; color: #1b6d85">
    The <span style="color: #00dd00">employee</span> profiles are set only</br> 
    by <span style="color: #00dd00">admin user</span> through admin panel. Admin have</br> to <span style="color: #00dd00">assign

* It has One BaseUser model and two children for</br> 
different user roles(EmployeeBio and ClientProfile).


* Models have additional validators for img size and</br> 
phone number validation.


* Every new user is set as client with the help of a signal.
* Upon creation the signal checks if the new user has status and</br> 
if not employee- it is set as client.
    

* The user has option to authenticat with its email. 
* The 'ModelBackend' is rewritten.

* It has also an option to log in with Google email. 
* It uses a pipeline which checks if the user logs for first time,</br> 
redirecting it to fill a form for completing it's profile(Save in DB).
* The authentication process goes through SOCIAL_AUTH_PIPELINE steps using </br> 
social authentication, such as Google authentication via django-allauth </br> 
or social-auth-app-django.
* They are arranged in order and sepparated with comments for better readability.


* The client profile has full CRUD operations on his profil and can:
  * upload profile picture;
  * edit profil info;
  * delete profil.
  

* In addition, the employee profil has a biography section and has the </br> 
permission to add certificates, which appear in the Contacts page as</br> 
part of personal business card.
